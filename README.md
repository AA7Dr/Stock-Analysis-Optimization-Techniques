# -Stock-Portfolio-Optimization-Analysis
# This project  analyzes historical stock data to create an optimized investment portfolio. Using the Financial Modeling Prep API, I fetched historical price data for several companies and calculated daily returns. I performed a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 1,000 random portfolios with different asset allocations, then computed key portfolio metrics such as expected return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio. The goal was to find the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, indicating the best risk-adjusted return. The results were visualized with a cumulative return plot to track portfolio performance over time.
