# Mom: Momentum factor (based on stock price momentum)

# By running this regression:

# You're attempting to explain the stock's excess returns based on the Fama-French 5-factor model (with the addition of the momentum factor).
# The alpha (Î±) term in this regression tells you how much of the stock's return is unexplained by these factors, which is often interpreted as a measure of "abnormal" returns. A positive alpha suggests that the stock performed better than predicted by the factors, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance.
